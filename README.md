# 📚 Relearning Math & Algorithms

This repository is a personal journey to solidify my understanding of fundamental mathematics and algorithms. My primary goal is to re-engage with these concepts, reinforce theoretical knowledge, and implement them practically.

## 🚀 Project Goals

*   **Deepen Understanding:** Revisit and gain a more profound comprehension of core mathematical principles and algorithmic paradigms.
*   **Practical Implementation:** Translate theoretical knowledge into working code.
*   **Problem Solving:** Apply learned concepts to solve classic and challenging problems.
*   **Language Exploration (Potential):** While current implementations primarily focus on Python, I may explore other languages to diversify my understanding and skill set.

## ✨ What You'll Find Here

This repository will contain:

*   **Mathematical Concepts:** Implementations and explanations of various mathematical topics (e.g., number theory, linear algebra, calculus foundations).
*   **Algorithmic Solutions:** Implementations of common algorithms and data structures (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming).
*   **Problem Sets:** Solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Project Euler, or competitive programming archives.
*   **Notes & Explanations:** Personal notes or brief write-ups on challenging concepts.

## 🐍 Technologies & Languages

*   **Primary Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Potential Future Languages:** (e.g., JavaScript, Rust, C++, Go) - *To be decided as the project evolves.*
*   **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, various testing frameworks.

## 🤝 Contributions & Feedback

This is a personal learning project, but feedback and suggestions are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue if you spot something or have a better approach.
